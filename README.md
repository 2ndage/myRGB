# myRGB
My foray into controlling all the RGB in my new desktop PC under Ubuntu 24.04

# Platform
The code was written in C# NET 9.0 and runs on Ubuntu 24.04 as a background service.

# Components
Each component with RGB in my system is listed below:<br>
1. Motherboard: Gigabyte Aorus Z790 Elite X WiFi 7<br>
2. Memory: Corsair Dominator Platinum<br>
3. Graphics Card: Gigabyte RTX 5070 Ti<br>
4. Cooler: Kraken Elite 360<br>

A separate md file was created to explain the communications used to control the RGB for each component.<br>
