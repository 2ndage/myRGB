# myRGB
My foray into controlling all the RGB in my new desktop PC under Ubuntu 24.04

# Platform
The code was written in C# NET 9.0 and runs on Ubuntu 24.04 as a background service.

# Components
Each component with RGB in my system is listed below:<br>
1. Motherboard: [Gigabyte Aorus Z790 Elite X WiFi 7](https://github.com/2ndage/myRGB/blob/main/Gigabyte%20Aorus%20Z790%20Elite%20X%20WiFi%207.md)<br>
